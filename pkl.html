          The Pro Kabaddi League (PKL), currently known as Vivo Pro Kabaddi
          League for sponsorship purposes, is a professional-level kabaddi
          league in India. It was launched in 2014 and is broadcast on Star
          Sports. The league's inception was influenced by the popularity of the
          kabaddi tournament at the 2006 Asian Games. The format of the
          competition was influenced by Indian Premier League. The Pro Kabaddi
          League uses a franchise-based model and its first season was held in
          2014 with eight teams each of which having paid fees of up to
          US$250,000 to join. There were doubts over whether the PKL would be
          successful, noting that there were many leagues attempting to emulate
          the IPL's business model and success, and that unlike cricket, there
          were relatively fewer well-known players in Kabaddi. However, it was
          also noted that kabaddi was widely played in grassroots community
          settings, and could thus attract a wide variety of rural and
          metropolitan viewers for advertisers to target if the league gained
          significant traction.For the 2017 and 2018-19 season, the PKL added
          four new teams, and changed its format to split the teams into two
          divisions known as "zones". Soon the league returned to its regular
          double round-robin format for the 2019 season.The inaugural season was
          seen by 435 million viewers, second to the 2014 Indian Premier
          League's 552 million, while the first season final between Jaipur Pink
          Panthers and U-Mumba was watched by 86.4 million. Star Sports, the
          PKL's broadcaster, subsequently announced in 2015 that it would
          acquire a 74% stake in the league's parent company Mashal Sports.For
          the 2017 and 2018-19 season, the PKL added four new teams, and changed
          its format to split the teams into two divisions known as "zones".
          Soon the league returned to its regular double round-robin format for
          the 2019 season.As per the available data of the opening two weeks,
          Star Sports Pro Kabaddi viewership on TV increased by nearly 56% from
          the 2014 year's viewership. During the inaugural season, viewership
          was 43.5 crore (435 million) viewers, which was the second in India
          after the 56 crore (560 million) of IPL viewership. The online
          viewership also increased 1.3 crore unique visitors, which is 18.5
          times than of last year's 7 lakh unique visitors. The third season
          which was flagged off on 30 January, recorded a surge in viewership
          with the opening week ratings 36 percent higher than the week one
          viewership for its last season.

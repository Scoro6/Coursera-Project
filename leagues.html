          <p data-aos="fade-left">
            The Indian Super League (ISL) is a professional football league in
            India. At the top of the Indian league system, it is the country's
            joint-premier football league competition, together with the
            I-League. The league is currently contested by ten teams and each
            season runs from October to March. Each team currently plays 18
            matches during the league stage, with the top four qualifying for
            the playoffs. The season then culminates with the ISL Final to
            determine the champion. The league has been officially known as the
            Hero Indian Super League since its inception, due to a sponsorship
            agreement with Hero MotoCorp.The competition was founded on 21
            October 2013 with the goal of growing the sport of football in India
            and increasing its exposure in the country. The league began in
            October 2014 with eight teams. During its first three seasons, the
            competition operated without official recognition from the Asian
            Football Confederation (AFC), the governing body for the sport in
            Asia. The competition was also structured along the same lines as
            the Indian Premier League, the country's premier Twenty20 cricket
            competition. Each season lasted just 3 months, from October to
            December, and matches were held daily. However, prior to the 2017–18
            season, the league expanded to ten teams, expanded its schedule to
            six months, and earned recognition from the AFC.Unlike other
            football leagues around the world, the Indian Super League does not
            use promotion and relegation, choosing to grow through expansion,
            similar to Major League Soccer in the United States.Since the
            league's inaugural season, a total of three clubs have won the ISL
            Final and one club has won the ISL League Winners Shield, the trophy
            awarded to the top team at the end of the league stage. The current
            ISL champions are ATK. The club is also the league's most
            successful, having won the title three times.

          <p data-aos="fade-left">
            The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket
            league in India contested during March or April and May of every
            year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India.
            The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India
            (BCCI) in 2008. The IPL has an exclusive window in ICC Future Tours
            Programme. The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world
            and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports
            leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the
            world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in
            2019 was ₹475 billion (US$6.7 billion), according to Duff & Phelps.
            According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹11.5 billion
            (US$160 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy. There have been
            twelve seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders
            are the Mumbai Indians, who won the 2019 season. The 2020 season has
            been indefinitely suspended due to the ongoing COVID-19
            pandemic.Currently, with eight teams, each team plays each other
            twice in a home-and-away round-robin format in the league phase. At
            the conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams will qualify
            for the playoffs. The top two teams from the league phase will play
            against each other in the first Qualifying match, with the winner
            going straight to the IPL final and the loser getting another chance
            to qualify for the IPL final by playing the second Qualifying match.
            Meanwhile, the third and fourth place teams from league phase play
            against each other in an eliminator match and the winner from that
            match will play the loser from the first Qualifying match.

          <h2 data-aos="fade-right">Pro Kabaddi League</h2>
          <p data-aos="fade-left">
            The Pro Kabaddi League (PKL), currently known as Vivo Pro Kabaddi
            League for sponsorship purposes, is a professional-level kabaddi
            league in India. It was launched in 2014 and is broadcast on Star
            Sports. The league's inception was influenced by the popularity of
            the kabaddi tournament at the 2006 Asian Games. The format of the
            competition was influenced by Indian Premier League. The Pro Kabaddi
            League uses a franchise-based model and its first season was held in
            2014 with eight teams each of which having paid fees of up to
            US$250,000 to join. There were doubts over whether the PKL would be
            successful, noting that there were many leagues attempting to
            emulate the IPL's business model and success, and that unlike
            cricket, there were relatively fewer well-known players in Kabaddi.
            However, it was also noted that kabaddi was widely played in
            grassroots community settings, and could thus attract a wide variety
            of rural and metropolitan viewers for advertisers to target if the
            league gained significant traction.For the 2017 and 2018-19 season,
            the PKL added four new teams, and changed its format to split the
            teams into two divisions known as "zones". Soon the league returned
            to its regular double round-robin format for the 2019 season.The
            inaugural season was seen by 435 million viewers, second to the 2014
            Indian Premier League's 552 million, while the first season final
            between Jaipur Pink Panthers and U-Mumba was watched by 86.4
            million. Star Sports, the PKL's broadcaster, subsequently announced
            in 2015 that it would acquire a 74% stake in the league's parent
            company Mashal Sports.

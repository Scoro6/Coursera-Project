          The Indian Super League (ISL) is a professional football league in
          India. At the top of the Indian league system, it is the country's
          joint-premier football league competition, together with the I-League.
          The league is currently contested by ten teams and each season runs
          from October to March. Each team currently plays 18 matches during the
          league stage, with the top four qualifying for the playoffs. The
          season then culminates with the ISL Final to determine the champion.
          The league has been officially known as the Hero Indian Super League
          since its inception, due to a sponsorship agreement with Hero
          MotoCorp.The competition was founded on 21 October 2013 with the goal
          of growing the sport of football in India and increasing its exposure
          in the country. The league began in October 2014 with eight teams.
          During its first three seasons, the competition operated without
          official recognition from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), the
          governing body for the sport in Asia. The competition was also
          structured along the same lines as the Indian Premier League, the
          country's premier Twenty20 cricket competition. Each season lasted
          just 3 months, from October to December, and matches were held daily.
          However, prior to the 2017–18 season, the league expanded to ten
          teams, expanded its schedule to six months, and earned recognition
          from the AFC.Unlike other football leagues around the world, the
          Indian Super League does not use promotion and relegation, choosing to
          grow through expansion, similar to Major League Soccer in the United
          States.Since the league's inaugural season, a total of three clubs
          have won the ISL Final and one club has won the ISL League Winners
          Shield, the trophy awarded to the top team at the end of the league
          stage. The current ISL champions are ATK. The club is also the
          league's most successful, having won the title three times. The
          current Winners Shield trophy holder is Goa, who have won it once
          since the trophy was unveiled during the 2019–20 season.

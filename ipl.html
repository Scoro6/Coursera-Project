          The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket
          league in India contested during March or April and May of every year
          by eight teams representing eight different cities in India. The
          league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
          in 2008. The IPL has an exclusive window in ICC Future Tours
          Programme. The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world
          and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports
          leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world
          to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 2019
          was ₹475 billion (US$6.7 billion), according to Duff & Phelps.
          According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹11.5 billion
          (US$160 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy. There have been
          twelve seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders
          are the Mumbai Indians, who won the 2019 season. The 2020 season has
          been indefinitely suspended due to the ongoing COVID-19
          pandemic.Currently, with eight teams, each team plays each other twice
          in a home-and-away round-robin format in the league phase. At the
          conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams will qualify for
          the playoffs. The top two teams from the league phase will play
          against each other in the first Qualifying match, with the winner
          going straight to the IPL final and the loser getting another chance
          to qualify for the IPL final by playing the second Qualifying match.
          Meanwhile, the third and fourth place teams from league phase play
          against each other in an eliminator match and the winner from that
          match will play the loser from the first Qualifying match.Currently,
